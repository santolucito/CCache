;
; Just for fun I've ported LZO to my old Atari ST. This fine machine
; is powered by a Motorola 68000 CPU with 16-bit ints, 32-bit longs,
; 32-bit size_t and a flat memory with 32-bit pointers.
;

;
; WARNING:
;   do *not* use Turbo C 2.03 (the predecessor of Pure C) - the
;   implementation of arrays that are indexed by long integers is
;   broken and wrong code will be produced in some cases
;
