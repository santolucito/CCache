User visible changes for LZO -- a real-time data compression library
============================================================================

Changes in 1.08 (12 Jul 2002)
  * much better support for cross compiling
  * straighten out ANSI-conforming compiler checks
  * avoid harmless compiler warnings reported by -Wcast-align
  * fixed some sign extension problems on rather exotic machines where
    sizeof(size_t) < sizeof(ptrdiff_t) and sizeof(lzo_uint) == sizeof(size_t)
  * updated the configure system to use the latest Autoconf, Automake
    and Libtool versions

Changes in 1.07 (18 Oct 2000)
  * Default to `--disable-shared' (I'm getting tired of Libtool's
    shared library build problems, this time AIX was the culprit)
  * As usual, updated the configure system to use the latest
    Autoconf, Automake and Libtool versions.
  * avoid some harmless compiler warnings.

Changes in 1.06 (29 Nov 1999)
  * Updated the configure system to use Autoconf 2.13, Automake 1.4 and
    Libtool 1.3.3. This should hopefully fix the shared-library build
    problems that were reported on some machines.
  * enhanced example programs a little bit

Changes in 1.05 (14 Apr 1998)
  * just a one-line change in the configure script to workaround
    a HPUX and IRIX building problem

  * adapted for Automake 1.2f and Libtool 1.1

Changes in 1.03 (18 Jan 1998)
  * minor compression ratio improvement
  * extended example program to show how to do overlapping compression

Changes in 0.90 (27 Jun 1997): never released

    invalid compressed data in very rare cases

Changes in 0.26 (18 Jan 1997): never released
  * implemented LZO1B-999
  * renamed LZO1D to LZO2A (also updated all docs)
  * some cleanups

Changes in 0.25 (28 Dec 1996): never released

  * added corresponding LZO_PUBLIC to all LZO_EXTERN functions
  * added support for Microsoft C 7.0 (16-bit DOS)

  * some speed improvements in LZO1C-999 and LZO2A-999

Changes in 0.12 (18 Jun 1996): never released

    intended for generating pre-compressed data
  * added tests for lookbehind-overrun in all safe decompressors
  * source tree completely rearranged, some filenames changed
  * extensions changed: a .ch file is a C source code that is included
    for reasons of code sharing
  * new algorithm LZO2A: LZO2A-999 and LZO2A decompressor. There is
    no fast compressor yet.
  * some cleanups
