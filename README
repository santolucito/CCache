This is my Senior Thesis at Amherst College

This is just here in case I lose everything or really screw something up

The "test-compression" will take an LRU trace and spit out a "compression trace"

A "compression trace" is a record of each page that went in/out of th cache (or something) when the LRU trace was collected

The size-adapt dir will take that compression trace and do the actual adaptive compressed caching experiment.
